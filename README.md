[Bright Data’s CAPTCHA Solver](https://github.com/luminati-io/Captcha-solver) allows for advanced customization to fine-tune solving logic for specific scenarios.

### **Custom Options for hCaptcha Challenges**  
```javascript
// Define default options for different CAPTCHA types
function getCaptchaOptions(captchaType, customOptions = {}) {
  const defaultOptions = {
    timeout: 30000, // Maximum time (in ms) to wait for CAPTCHA solving
    check_timeout: 500, // Interval (in ms) to check the CAPTCHA's status
    wait_networkidle: { timeout: 1000 }, // Wait until the network is idle for 1 second
    debug: false // Debug mode (disabled by default)
  };

  // Define CAPTCHA-specific selectors
  const captchaSelectors = {
    DataDome: { selector: '#datadome-captcha', success_selector: '#captcha-success' },
    reCAPTCHA: { selector: '.g-recaptcha', success_selector: '.recaptcha-success' },
    ClickCaptcha: { selector: '.click-captcha', success_selector: '.captcha-passed' },
    hCaptcha: { selector: '.h-captcha', success_selector: '.hcaptcha-success' },
    PerimeterX: { selector: '#px-captcha', success_selector: '#px-success' },
    SimpleCaptcha: { selector: '.simple-captcha', success_selector: '.captcha-done' },
    FunCaptcha: { selector: '.funcaptcha', success_selector: '.funcaptcha-success' },
    CloudflareTurnstile: { selector: '.cf-turnstile', success_selector: '.cf-success' },
    AWSWAF: { selector: '#aws-waf-captcha', success_selector: '#aws-waf-success' },

    YandexCAPTCHA: { selector: '#yandex-captcha', success_selector: '#yandex-success' },
    ImageCAPTCHA: { selector: '.image-captcha', success_selector: '.image-captcha-success' },
    TextCAPTCHA: { selector: '.text-captcha', success_selector: '.text-captcha-success' }
  };

  // Get the correct selectors for the given CAPTCHA type
  const selectedOptions = captchaSelectors[captchaType] || {};

  // Merge default options with selected CAPTCHA-specific options and any custom overrides
  return { ...defaultOptions, ...selectedOptions, ...customOptions };
}

// Example usage for different CAPTCHA types
const ddOptions = getCaptchaOptions('DataDome', { timeout: 40000, debug: true });
const recaptchaOptions = getCaptchaOptions('reCAPTCHA', { debug: true });
const hcaptchaOptions = getCaptchaOptions('hCaptcha');

console.log(ddOptions);
console.log(recaptchaOptions);
console.log(hcaptchaOptions);

// Example error handling
try {
  if (!document.querySelector(ddOptions.selector)) {
    throw new Error(`CAPTCHA element not found using selector: ${ddOptions.selector}`);
  }

  // Your CAPTCHA-solving logic here
  solveCaptcha(ddOptions);
} catch (error) {
  console.error('Failed to solve CAPTCHA:', error.message);
}

## **Event Monitoring**  
Track CAPTCHA-solving events to handle advanced use cases:
